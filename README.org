This repo contains my notes and code for coursework from [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/claude-code/home/info][Claude Code:
Software Engineering with Generative AI Agents]] taught by Professor Jules
White, Professor Computer Science at Vanderbilt University in Nashville,
Tennessee.

The course consists of the following 7 modules:

- (1) Scaling Up Software Engineering with Claude Code & Generative AI
- (2) Leveraging the Software Engineering Advantages of Claude Code
- (3) Generative AI, Claude Code, & Code Quality
- (4) Building Process & Context in Claude Code
- (5) Version Control & Parallel Development with Claude Code
- (6) Improving Claude Code Scalability & Reasoning
- (7) Multimodal Prompting & Process

There is one homework assignment, /Create your Process/ at the end of
Module 7 in which the student is required to describe what kind of
information they will include in their ~CLAUDE.md~ file, which gives
basic context and guidelines for Claude Code to use when working in a
source code repository.
